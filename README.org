* What is Replay?

  Replay is a tool for replaying logged actions in live time. It’s
  useful for simulating load on a develpoment or test system.


* How Does It Work?

  You need two things:

  1. A function or generator which returns a sequence of tuples of
     (timestamp, data). It’s strongly advised that you use a generator.

  2. A function which accepts the data and does something with it.

  If you feed these into =replay.mapc_time=, it will fire your
  processing function in live time – the time delta between the
  timestamps from your seq is the delay in between calls to your
  processing function.


* Okay, But How Do I Use It?

  See =examples/= for a real-world use case, replaying Apache logs
  against a test server.
